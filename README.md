# Word-Guess-CLI
This hangman-style game is played in Node.js using constructors.  The index file is the one used to run the game and the user will be prompted to enter a letter in order to guess the word. If the letter is in the word, it will be be added; but if it is not, you will only have 8 attempts to guess the correct word before you lose the game.
